# Types of Operators in Pyhton

# Arithmetic Operators
    1. add +
    2. sub -
    3. mul *
    4. div /   # always results the float value
    5. int div //  # it works as floor wich retuns th smallest integer value (but written as float)
    6. modulo %   # returns the remainder after division (returns negative value if only the divisor is negative )
    7. power **   # return the power of a value 2**3 == 8

# Comparison Operators
    1. equal ==
    2. not equal !=
    3. greater than >
    4. less than <
    5. greater than or equal to >=
    6. less than or equal to <=
    # you must try clever if statements to understand the comparison operators better

# Logical Operators
    1. and
    2. or
    3. not

# Assignment Operators
    1. =  # assignment
    2. += # add and assign
    3. -= # subtract and assign
    4. *= # multiply and assign
    5. /= # divide and assign
    6. %= # modulo and assign
    7. //= # int div and assign
    8. **= # power and assign

# Identity Operators
    1. is
    2. is not

# Membership Operators
    1. in
    2. not in   
# Bitwise Operators
    1. &  # bitwise AND
    2. |  # bitwise OR
    3. ^  # bitwise XOR
    4. ~  # bitwise NOT
    5. << # left shift
    6. >> # right shift
# FACTS 

#no.1 
    If you want a positive value use abs() .
